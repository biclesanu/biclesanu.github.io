                        Hi! I'm Alisa Bîcleșanu. 
                        I was born in Timișoara, in 2004.
                        <br></br>
                        I'm a person who likes both the logical and artistic aspects of life. I spend my time learning about robots, programming, painting and sculpting.
                        <br></br>
                        I consider myself a sport's person as well. With the exception of the pandemic, I never stopped practicing sports. Practicing a sport gave me the sense of belonging to a group and it taught me discipline.
                        <br></br>
                        One of my core memories is my first math class, learning addition and subtraction. Since then, I kept looking for math in the world around me. This set me on the course towards programming and robotics, two subjects that became really important in my life. Art classes were my favorite moment of the week. Art became a part of me and I spent a lot of my time perfecting my skills. I started canvas painting, making sculptures, making clay figurines and handmade jewelry. I always worked until I felt satisfied with the results, until I felt my emotions were accurately transposed into form.
                        <br></br>
                        In the future, I hope to be in a place where my logical and artistic selves can truly interact. Somewhere in the robotics field, where I could contribute to making the world a better place and helping humanity evolve. I wish for my free time to be occupied by art, fully. I want to find my style of art and create as many pieces as possible. I want to love what I do, do what I love.

                        In high school I discovered I really like the computer science class. I started learning to code in my free time. I think coding and painting are very similar: you need a vision of what the project is going to look like in the end, and you need to start small, tiny steps. You work a bit here, a bit there, and all of the sudden, the big picture forms. Yet the biggest similarity is how much freedom of expression they both give.
